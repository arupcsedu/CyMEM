Controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of CAT . A CAA review found that " mixing [ commercial ] operations with other users is considered undesirable , even untenable " by commercial operators .

Coupled with pilot navigation errors , hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year .
