In the writing of his novel , Qian Cai used a different character when spelling Zhou 's given name . Instead of the original character meaning " similar " , it was changed to 侗 , meaning " rude or rustic " . So , " 周侗 " represents Zhou 's distinct fictional persona . This spelling has even been carried over into modern day martial arts manuals .
