Their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little , and they are usually sure @-@ footed and tough .

Kaimanawa horses have a short , deep neck with a thick throat area , straight shoulders , a deep girth , and a short to medium back . The hindquarters vary from sloping to well @-@ rounded .
