Many reviews singled out " Nice Weather for Ducks " as the album 's stand @-@ out track . Mason selected the " dreamy , acoustic guitar @-@ based " song as one of the album 's highlights in his review . Dahlen described it as " the most likeable " on the album , and concluded that it is " a happy @-@ slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up : Sunny , bright , and vaguely irritating . " Wysel wrote , " When the flugelhorn arrives on ' Nice Weather for Ducks ' it is impossible to believe there is any evil in the world . " Conversely , several critics felt that " Experiment Number Six " did not fit with the mood of the rest of the album . Wysel called it a " pool of darkness " that " comes as quite a shock . " Dahlen felt that the song is " is the only break in the [ album 's ] mood . " While he enjoyed the song 's concept , calling it " so different and sinister that it 's more intriguing than the rest of the album " , he felt that it was " annoyingly displaced . " Hermann , on the other hand , called the track " clever " and " spooky " with " music ... so well crafted that [ the concept ] works " .
