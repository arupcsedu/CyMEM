Turner 's seniority was called critical for the performance of the team 's relatively youthful offensive line .

" Upon the conclusion of preseason camp , the coaching staff praised his progress , particularly his game @-@ planning , for which he had been criticized in the past . Turner said , " Mentally , I am way further ahead than where I was last year .
