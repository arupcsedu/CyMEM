Harrison was pleasantly surprised when he got a call from Beyoncé , who was working on one of the most anticipated albums of the year . However , things did not turn up according to his plans the following day as he was late and was still suffering the effects of a hangover . When Harrison played the sample to Beyoncé in the studio , the singer initially had doubts about the " sound so full of blaring fanfare " ; it seemed too retro and according to her , no one used horn riffs in the 21st century . Nevertheless , Beyoncé became friendlier to the sample much to Harrison 's delight and gave him two hours to write the song while she went out .
