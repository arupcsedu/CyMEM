Tech continued to drive , picking up short yardage with multiple rushes . The Hokies suffered a near @-@ disaster when Lawrence fumbled the ball , but Tech retained possession when the ball rolled out of bounds at the one @-@ yard line .

Following the extra point , Tech cut Miami 's lead to 14 – 10 with 8 : 52 remaining in the quarter .
