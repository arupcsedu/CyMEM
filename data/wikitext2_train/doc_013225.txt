It has been suggested that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel 's second son Qedar . Though the tribal name is Arabic , it was first transcribed in Assyrian ( 8th century BCE ) and Aramaic ( 6th century BCE ) , as the Arabic alphabet had not yet been developed . In the Mareshah onomasticon , the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic transliteration is QDRYN .
