Shapur I destroyed the Palmyrene trade colonies all along the Euphrates ( including the colonies at Anah in 253 and at Dura @-@ Europos in 256 ) ; Peter the Patrician says that Odaenathus approached Shapur to negotiate Palmyrene interests but was rebuffed and the gifts sent to the Persians were thrown into the river . The date for the attempted negotiations is debated ; Some scholars including John F. Drinkwater set the event in 253 while others such as Alaric Watson set it in 256 following the destruction of Dura @-@ Europos .
