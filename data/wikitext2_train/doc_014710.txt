These speculations cannot be proven without doubt but as a governor , Odaenathus would have been the highest authority in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials ; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province .

By 260 , Odaenathus held the rank , credibility and power to pacify the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa .
