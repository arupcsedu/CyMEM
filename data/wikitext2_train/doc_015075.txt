In 1947 , a novice bell ringer died in an accident when he tried to move one of the bells while standing under it . The bell swung back and hit him in the head , killing him instantly . The bell was then " punished " by removing the clapper . In the following years , the bell was known as la castigada ( " the punished one " ) , or la muda ( " the mute one " ) . In 2000 , the clapper was reinstalled in the bell .
