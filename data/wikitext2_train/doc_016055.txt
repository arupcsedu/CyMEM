Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966 , Dylan created a body of work that remains unique . Drawing on folk , blues , country , R & B , rock 'n'roll , gospel , British beat , symbolist , modernist and Beat poetry , surrealism and Dada , advertising jargon and social commentary , Fellini and Mad magazine , he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision . The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console . "
