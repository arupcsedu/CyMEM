Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music . In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom , Nik Cohn objected : " I can 't take the vision of Dylan as seer , as teenage messiah , as everything else he 's been worshipped as . The way I see him , he 's a minor talent with a major gift for self @-@ hype . " Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star : " What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant , faux @-@ cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since , with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook .
