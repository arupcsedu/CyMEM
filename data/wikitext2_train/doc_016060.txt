Fellow musicians also presented dissenting views . Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a " plagiarist " and his voice as " fake " in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times , in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both created personas . Mitchell 's comment led to discussions of Dylan 's use of other people 's material , both supporting and criticizing him . In 2013 Mitchell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) in an interview that her remarks in the Los Angeles Times had been taken " completely out of context " , and that the interviewer was a " moron " . Mitchell added : " I like a lot of Bob 's songs . Musically he 's not very gifted . He 's borrowed his voice from old hillbillies . He 's got a lot of borrowed things . He 's not a great guitar player . He 's invented a character to deliver his songs . "
