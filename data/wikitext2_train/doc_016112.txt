Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia , including the Mogadishu area , was inhabited very early by hunter @-@ gatherers of Khoisan descent . Although most of these early inhabitants are believed to have been either overwhelmed , driven away or , in some cases , assimilated by later migrants to the area , physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern @-@ day Jubaland and other parts of the south . The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile , Aweer , the Wa @-@ Ribi , and especially the Wa @-@ Boni . By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn ( Digil and Mirifle ) clan confederacy , who would go on to establish a local aristocracy , other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo ( Wardai ) and Ajuuraan ( Ma 'adanle ) had already formed settlements of their own in the sub @-@ region .
