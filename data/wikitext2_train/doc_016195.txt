The main area of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic minorities in Somalia has historically been in village enclaves in the south , particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys as well as the Bakool and Bay regions . Beginning in the 1970s , more Bantus began moving to urban centres such as Mogadishu and Kismayo . The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities migrating to urban areas . As a consequence of these movements , Mogadishu 's traditional demographic makeup changed significantly over the years .
