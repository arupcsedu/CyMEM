The National Museum of Somalia was established after independence in 1960 , when the old Garesa Museum was turned into a National Museum . The National Museum was later moved in 1985 , renamed to the Garesa Museum , and converted to a regional museum . After shutting down , the National Museum later reopened . As of January 2014 , it holds many culturally important artefacts , including old coins , bartering tools , traditional artwork , ancient weaponry and pottery items .
