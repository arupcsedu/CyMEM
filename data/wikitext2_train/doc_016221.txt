It was one of the largest markets in the city before closing down operations in the early 1990s . In September 2014 , the municipal authorities officially reopened the Ansaloti to the public , with officials supervising all parts of the market . According to the Benadir Political Affairs Vice Chairman Mohamed Adan " Anagel " , the facility is now open for business and will compete with other regional markets .
