Jam , Lewis and Carey also worked " Yours " , which Jam said contains " probably one of the best hooks [ ever ] " , and likened it to one of trio 's previous collaborations , " Thank God I Found You " ( 2000 ) . Initially , the song was recorded as duet with pop singer Justin Timberlake . However , due to contractual complications , it was never released and the a solo version was featured on the album . Jam and Lewis produced two more songs , " Wedding Song " and " Satisfy " — the latter featuring background vocals from Michael Jackson — which were not released on the album .
