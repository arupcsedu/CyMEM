Carey 's cover of " Bringin ' On the Heartbreak " , was recorded using live instrumentation , and was the album 's third single . It begins as a " piano @-@ driven slow jam " , which is followed by a " dramatic chord progression " after the second chorus , and Carey 's " precise and fluttery voice reaches incredible heights " as it " turns the power ballad into something more delicate . " Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called " Yours " " a delectable combination of breathy vocals and playful rhythms . " Barry Walters from Rolling Stone wrote that on " Yours " , " Carey 's lead vocals blend into choruses of overdubbed Mariah 's cooing overlapping phrases . Circling these are choirs of more Mariahs singing harmonies and countermelodies . Topping it off are generous sprinklings of the singer 's patented birdcalls , wails , sighs and whispers . "
