Critics considered " Subtle Invitation " to be one of the album 's strongest songs because of its " well executed " jazz influence . The song begins with the sounds of people dining , then introduces the strong bassline and drums . Towards the end of the song , Carey belts out the climax . Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote , " it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice . " " Clown " drew strong media attention , and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem , who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey . Rodman said " Clown " was " languidly sinister " , with lyrics such as , " I should 've left it at ' I like your music too ' ... You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other . " Critics compared " I Only Wanted " with " My All " ' s instrumentation and structure of verse , chorus and guitar solo . According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine , Carey makes vague allusions to her ex @-@ husband Tommy Mottola with the line , " Wish I 'd stayed beneath my veil " . The song uses Latin @-@ inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody , and dripping water as its percussion .
