On 12 June he was again tested in the highest class when he was sent to run in the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp where he was ridden by Fred Archer . Tristan was beaten a head after a " superb race " with the American colt Foxhall , ridden by George Fordham . The French crowd treated the defeat of Tristan as a home victory and joined the sizable American contingent in the celebrations which were described as “ the wildest ever seen at Longchamp ” . It was only after the intervention of the local police force that Fordham and Archer were able to return to the weighing room . He won a race called the Prix de Deauville ( not to be confused with the Grand Prix de Deauville ) before returning to England . In July he won the six furlong Horseheath Stakes at Newmarket " in a canter " at odds of 2 / 5 and the Singleton Stakes at Goodwood . In August he traveled back to France for his first attempt at the Grand Prix de Deauville and finished third to Castillon . On his return to Britain he finished last of three runners in the Great Yorkshire Stakes over one and three quarter miles at York .
