Lefevre retired Tristan to stand as a stallion in France at his stud near Chamant . In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline , Duchess of Montrose , who returned him to England as a replacement for the recently deceased Isonomy . Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria @-@ Hungary . In 1897 he died as a result of injuries sustained after dashing his head against the wall of his stable in a fit of temper . Tristan was not a great success as a stallion , but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim , who won the Epsom Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare . Other good winners included Le Nord ( Dewhurst Stakes ) and Le Nicham ( Champion Stakes ) .
