Plunketts Creek was a source of power in the nineteenth century and " water @-@ powered sawmills , woolen mills , and grist ( grain ) mills lined the ' Sock and Plunketts and Big Bear Creeks " . Although hemlock logs were originally left to rot after their bark was peeled for tanning , with time their lumber was used , among other places in a sawmill on Engle Run north of Proctor . By 1892 there were two steam powered sawmills on Plunketts Creek : one 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) above the mouth , and the other 4 @.@ 0 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) up the creek , near Hoppestown . An extension of the Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad crossed an unnamed tributary of Plunketts Creek near its source in Sullivan County in 1906 , running from the village of Hillsgrove northwest to the lumber boomtown of Masten in Cascade and McNett Townships in Lycoming County . A logging railroad was built by the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company ( CPL ) in the far northern part of the watershed in the 1920s . It crossed Engle Run twice and ran parallel to Wolf Run , near both their sources . No other railroads crossed or ran along Plunketts Creek .
