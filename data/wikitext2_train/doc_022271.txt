Retaliation had 700 visual effects shots , which were mostly handled by three effects companies . Visual effects supervisor Zachary Kinnery declared that while the visuals aimed for the " big and bold " typical of the franchise , Retaliation would be the first to attempt " a bit more of that gritty realism . " The major part of the effects was given to Digital Domain , which for 227 effects created digital vehicles and aircraft that had to " look fantastic but which are also plausible " , given they had to match practical models , the Zeus satellite and a sequence where Zartan shows his nanomite @-@ related disguise to the president - done with the same head replacement software developed for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Tron : Legacy . Industrial Light & Magic made the London destruction , a digital White House , and the mountain sword fight , which had computer @-@ generated backgrounds and digital augmentation of the stunt people 's performance . Method Studios was responsible for the desert attack , Firefly 's explosive bugs , and the malfunction on the underground prison . Saints LA handled minor effects such as compositing and news graphics .
