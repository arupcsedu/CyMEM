Kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks . The period shrinks for females raising young , and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around 15 months . The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot , covers it with brush , and returns to feed over a period of days . The cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger , and rarely consumes prey it has not killed , but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California , suggesting more opportunistic behavior .
