Only females are involved in parenting . Female cougars are fiercely protective of their cubs , and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as Grizzly bears in their defense . Litter size is between one and six cubs ; typically two . Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens . Born blind , cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first , and begin to be weaned at around three months of age . As they grow , they begin to go out on forays with their mother , first visiting kill sites , and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own . Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter . When cougars are born , they have spots , but they lose them as they grow , and by the age of 2 1 / 2 years , they will completely be gone
