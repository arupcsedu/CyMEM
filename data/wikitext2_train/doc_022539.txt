Two Sorraia stallions were imported to the United States in the early 21st century . In 2006 , another Sorraia stallion was imported to Canada where a Sorraia Mustang Preserve has been established on Manitoulin Island in Ontario . Unrelated to existing preservation efforts which work in conjunction with the Sorraia Mustang Studbook , another project by a consortium of breeders in the United States is attempting to establish a separate network and studbook . These breeders have gathered Spanish Mustangs that through mtDNA testing show a genetic relationship with the Sorraia and are breeding them according to both genotype and phenotype in an attempt to help preserve what they are calling the " American Sorraia " .
