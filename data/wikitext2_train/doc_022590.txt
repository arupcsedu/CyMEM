A branch of the Hejaz railway , known as the Jezreel Valley railway , was built between 1903 and 1905 . This event accelerated the growth of Haifa , which became a township ( nahiya ) centre in Akka in the sanjak of Beyrut Eyalet before the end of Ottoman rule . The Technion Institute of Technology was established around this time , that is , in 1912 .
