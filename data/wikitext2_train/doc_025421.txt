Joint collector Gaurav Uppal convened a meeting of film exhibitors and distributors , warning them against black @-@ marketing tickets to Magadheera . This was after local leaders , attempting to acquire a maximum number of tickets , blocked and booked tickets to the film in advance , to enthuse their supporters during the local civic polls in Guntur . Special teams of revenue , police and commercial tax officers were appointed to keep watch at ticket counters and ensure that each person was issued only one ticket . Priority was ordered to be given for the sanitation , safety and comfort of the viewers . Authorities in Vijayawada ensured the strict checking and prevention of black @-@ marketing of tickets . However , Ram Charan 's fans resorted to sloganeering and an impromptu protest demonstration in the office of Revenue Divisional Officer K. Hymavathi in Machilipatnam . They demanded the screening of a benefit show and the advance sale of tickets after being rejected by the management of the twin theatres , Siri Venkata and Siri Krishna , where the film was screened . Their plea was rejected by the officer , who said that the tickets would be issued only to those who came in queue and that no special concessions would be made for fans .
