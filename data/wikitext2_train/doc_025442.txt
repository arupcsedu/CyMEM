Suresh Krishnamoorthy of The Hindu summarised , " Magadheera is not for the weak @-@ hearted , those who do not like the sight of blood and neither is it for those who like movies with storylines that are much @-@ closer @-@ to @-@ everyday- reality . But Rajamouli excels in story @-@ telling . The way he has used the flashback as a flip switch , going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400 @-@ year journey in a jiffy is interesting . The rest is about how well technology , creativity , imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye @-@ pleasing experience for viewers . " B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote , " Despite a few narrative lapses , the much @-@ hyped semi @-@ periodic epic lives up to expectations . Unlike his previous action @-@ centric films , director Rajamouli dishes a heart @-@ touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly . Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film . " He added , " After not @-@ so @-@ impressive Chirutha , Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger @-@ than @-@ life role with ease . Similarly , Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses . Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain " , and rated the film 3 out of 5 .
