Oneindia Entertainment stated , " S. S. Rajamouli has chosen a fantastic love story for his movie Magadheera and linked it to a love story that dated back to some 400 years . He has filled complete energy in the film and no doubt , the graphic works and modern technology are perfectly used for the movie . As a whole , the film reminds the audiences of watching a Hollywood movie with perfect local flavor " , and called the film 's screenplay by Rajamouli a highlight . Upperstall.com stated " Magadheera is not an epic , not a legend , not even a cult movie , but it is certainly an artistic extravaganza and a sensory treat . Like we said before , a must watch ! A mast watch ! " .
