The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events . The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight , narrow 40 @-@ metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends . Jumps are measured from a take off board — typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached — which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line . The pole vault area is also a 40 @-@ metre running track and has an indentation in the ground ( the box ) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats . The high jump is a stripped down version of this , with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it .
