The episode opens with Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) receiving a speakerphone call about abnormal transactions on her credit card . The purchases turn out to all be legitimate , but Leslie cancels the card anyway out of embarrassment when Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) hears about her unusual purchases , including a " bucket of cake " , a man pillow in the shape of Daniel Craig , and tuition to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . Later , the parks department and Ann ( Rashida Jones ) visit neighboring Indiana town Eagleton to help build a playground in a single day , as part of an event by the charity KaBOOM ! There , Leslie and Ann find Ann 's ex @-@ boyfriend Andy ( Chris Pratt ) , who claims to be volunteering , but in reality , is coming for the free food . He tells Leslie and Ann that he now has a home with the drummer of his band . Leslie is inspired by the energy of the group and its leader Keef ( Paul Scheer ) , which prompts her to take proactive measures in filling in the pit in Pawnee and turning it into a park . While discussing the matter with her parks department , Mark ( Paul Schneider ) takes her aside and suggests she simply fill it in without permission . Leslie decides to take his advice and rents a bulldozer to fill in the pit .
