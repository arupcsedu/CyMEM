Applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis , which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few .

He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show .
