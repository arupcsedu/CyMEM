In the early 1990s , Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet , but he was stung by the resulting criticism . That year , he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level .

Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth .
